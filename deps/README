Maven artifact containing some dependencies of the Jabberwocky project,
made using maven-shade-plugin.

The main goal is to expose these dependencies so that p2 packages can include
them. If you use usual Maven <dependency> blocks in your project, you should
continue to use those and should not need this "deps" package at all.
